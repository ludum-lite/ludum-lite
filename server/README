Waiting for this to be resolved

Thinking about setting up docker to handle this setup and environment stuff
Node and nexus isn't playing nice with windows

Docker container for ludum backend
Docker container gql backend
Docker container for frontend

Setting up docker
- Installed Docker Desktop https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
- Tested to make sure it works https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
- Shared C drive https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#resources

Looks like it's going to be a lot of work to separate out vagrant from the project
I'll continue with running backend on the side for now
